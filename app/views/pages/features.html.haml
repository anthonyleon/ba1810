            %h1.marginbo REVERSE AUCTION

            %h1.marginbo AUTOMATED SALES LEADS
            %p.tit1 As users search for parts, vendors with the appropriate part are notified of the sale opportunity, which reduces time spent searching for leads and provides vendors with a larger reach of customers.

            %h1.marginbo SECURE PAYMENT
            %p.tit1 Protecting both buyers and vendors is our priority. Every payment is transferred into escrow prior to shipment to ensure that the seller will receive payment. This safeguard also protects the buyer since they must approve the delivery for payment to be released from the escrow account. All disputes are handled by a third party, NetNeutrals.com.
