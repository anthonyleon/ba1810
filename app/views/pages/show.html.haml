            .banner-decription
              A sourcing and procurement platform that utilizes a reverse auction business model.  Reverse auction flips the traditional roles of buyer and vendor to create healthy competition for your benefit. The buyer simply requests a part and allows the vendors to compete against each other to make the sale, ensuring fair market value for the sourced item. By implementing a supply chain adopted from Fortune 100 companies that meets ISM standards, Bid Aero provides the most efficient and transparent way to source the parts you need.
