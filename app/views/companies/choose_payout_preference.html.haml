								Escrow payments reduce the risk for buyers and sellers through using a trusted third-party to hold funds from a buyer and seller until goods or services have been delivered. Sellers can ship goods or provide services with confidence, knowing the buyer has paid, and buyers are sure that the seller will not paid until they have received the deliverables as expected.
							#Fees.tab-pane
								The Payoneer Escrow fee is based on the total value of the order, and will automatically be deducted from the funds held in escrow when they get released. The escrow fee schedule is calculated as follows: 
								%br
								%br
								● For an Order value up to $5,000: 4% of the order value
								%br
								● For an Order value from $5,000 to $50,000: $200 + 2.5% of the order value over $5,000
								%br
								● For an Order value from $50,000 to $500,000: $1,325 + 2% of the order value over $50,000
								%br
								● For an Order value over $500,000: $10,325 + 0.8% of the order value over $500,000
								%br
								● For an Order value over $1,000,000: $6,400 + 0.75% of order value over $1,000,000 
								%br
								%br
								Example: The fee for a $7,000 order is $250 [$200, plus 2.5% on ($7,000 - $5,000) = $50] 
								%br
								%br
								%br
								Notes: - The escrow fee is based on the total value of a completed order. The fee is payable at the time the funds are released from escrow, and will be automatically deducted. - If a transaction is cancelled by the seller, Payoneer will refund the full amount to the Buyer.
